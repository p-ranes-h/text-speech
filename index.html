      <h2 tabindex="0">Drawing</h2>
      <p tabindex="0" style="font-size:20px;">
        Drawing as formal artistic creation might be defined as the primarily linear rendition of objects in the visible world, as well as of concepts, thoughts, attitudes, emotions, and fantasies given visual form, of symbols and even of abstract forms. This definition, however, applies to all graphic arts and techniques that are characterized by an emphasis on form or shape rather than mass and colour, as in painting. Drawing as such differs from graphic printing processes in that a direct relationship exists between production and result. Drawing, in short, is the end product of a successive effort applied directly to the carrier. Whereas a drawing may form the basis for reproduction or copying, it is nonetheless unique by its very nature.</p>
        
        
     
       <p tabindex="0" style="font-size:20px;">Although not every artwork has been preceded by a drawing in the form of a preliminary sketch, drawing is in effect the basis of all visual arts. Often the drawing is absorbed by the completed work or destroyed in the course of completion. Thus, the usefulness of a ground plan drawing of a building that is to be erected decreases as the building goes up. Similarly, points and lines marked on a raw stone block represent auxiliary drawings for the sculpture that will be hewn out of the material. Essentially, every painting is built up of lines and pre-sketched in its main contours;only as the work proceeds is it consolidated into coloured surfaces. As shown by an increasing number
        of findings and investigations, drawings form the material basis of mural, panel, and book paintings. 
        Such preliminary sketches may merely indicate the main contours or may predetermine the final execution down to exact details. They may also be mere probing sketches. Long before the appearance of actual small-scale drawing, this procedure was much used for monumental murals. With sinopia the preliminary sketch found on a layer of its own on the wall underneath the fresco, or painting on freshly spread, moist plasterâ€”one reaches the point <br>at which a work that merely served as technical preparation becomes a formal drawing expressing an artistic intention.
      </p>
	     <h2 tabindex="0">Plane techniques</h2>
	   <p tabindex="0" style="font-size:20px;">Linear techniques of drawing are supplemented by plane methods, which can also be carried 
      out with crayon. For example, evenly applied dotting, which is better done with soft mediums, results in an 
      areal effect in uniform tone. Various values of the chiaroscuro (pictorial representation in terms of 
      light and shade without regard to colour) scale can also be rendered by means of dry or moist rubbing. Pulverized drawing materials that are rubbed into the drawing surface result in evenly toned areas that 
      serve both as a closed foundation for linear drawing and as indication of colour values for individual sections.
	   </p>
	   <h2 tabindex="0">Relationship between Drawing and illustration</h2>
	   <p tabindex="0" style="font-size:20px;">A drawing, by definition, is a type of visual expression that is often conveyed in two-dimension. It is often created through the use of paper, and a variety of different tools such as charcoal, colored pencils, pen and ink and the like. A drawing is often an exploratory form of visual art. This means that drawings pay considerable emphasis on observation, problem solving and composition. In most cases, drawings serve as a draft, or an outline, for other types of visual arts, such as painting. When an artist creates a drawing, he or she is focused more on the artistic rendition of a particular image. As such, the drawing may or may not exactly replicate the subject matter in real life. This is because drawings are predominantly utilized to convey the feelings and emotions evoked within the artist.
		<br>
	   On the other hand, an illustration is defined as the visual representation to provide emphasis or to accentuate a particular text. In this case, the rendition of the illustration is as close to the message of the text as possible, and is rarely created without having to tap into the impression that the viewers will get from viewing it. Illustrations are often used to provide faces to characters within a story, in order for the readers to be able to visualize the characters better, or to provide a visual representation of a particular theory presented in a textbook. Illustrations are not limited to visual representations of things in real life. Illustrations can also be graphs, charts and other forms of visual representations.
